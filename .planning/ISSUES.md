Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: Clarify admin module/note permissions in roadmap docs
- **Discovered:** Phase 07 Plan 02 Task 6 (2026-02-05)
- **Type:** Documentation
- **Description:** Roadmap role table states admins have full CRUD, but current rules and UI prevent admin create/update on modules and notes. Documentation should reflect the intended restriction.
- **Impact:** Low (no functional impact; prevents confusion)
- **Effort:** Quick
- **Suggested phase:** Phase 7
